# Options Futures and Other Derivatives

## Chapter 1: Introduction

In the last 30 years, derivatives have become icreasingly important
Futures and options are actively traded on many exchanges.

A derivative can be defined as a financial instrument whose value depends on (or derives from) the values of other, more basic, underlying variables. 
Often the underlying variables are the prices of the traded assets.

A stock options is an example of a derivative whose value is dependent oin the price of a stock, however they can be dependent on almost any variable, from the price of hogs to the amount of snow falling at a certain ski resort.

Derivative markets come under a great deal of criticism because of their role in the credit crisis that started in 2007. Derivative products were created from portfolios of risky mortgages in the US using a procedure known as securitization. Many of the products created became worthles swhen house prices declined, leading to finanicial institutions and investors losing large ammounts of money and sparking the great recession. Chapter 8 will explain securitization and how such losses occured.

### 1.1 Exchange Traded Markets

A derivatives exchage is a market where individuals trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange.
The first derivative exchanges was the Chicago Board of Trade, established in 1848 to bring farmers and merchants together.

Within a few years, the first futures-type contract was developed. It was known as a to-arrive contract.
Speculators soon became interested in the contract and found trading the contract itself to be an attractive alternative to the trading of grain itself.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange started trading call options contracts on 16 stocks in 19673. Options had traded prior to 1973, but the CBOE succeeded in creating an orderly market. Put contracts started trading on the exchange in 1977

#### Electronic Markets
Traditional derivative exchanges used the open outcry system. This involves traders physically meeting on the floor of the exchange, shouting, and using hand signals to indicate the trades they would like to carry out.

This has been rapidly outphased by electronic trading.

Electroinc Trading involves manually inputting desired values for given trades via web interfaces by keyboard and mouse.

This itself is undergoing a renaissance with the development of algorithmic trading, where computer programs are used to automatically generate and execute trades.

### 1.2 Over The Counter Markets
Not all trading of derivatives is done on exchanges. OTC Markets are important alternatives to exchanges, and measured in terms of the total volume of trading, has become much larger than exchange traded markets.

These are telephone and computer linked networks of dealers. Trades are done over the phone/computer between financial institutions and their clients . 

Telephone conversations in OTC markets are usually taped. If there is a dispute about what was agreed, the tapes are replayed to resolve the issue.
These trades are typically larger then trades on the exchange traded market.

Key Advantage: Terms of a contract do not have to be specified by an exchange. Participants are free to negotiate any mutually attractive deal.
Key Disadvantage: Usually some credit risk is involved.

#### Market Size
Both OTC and Exchange Traded Market for derivatives are huge.
Though statistics are hard to come by, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) estimates that the notional amount of outstanding OTC derivatives was $693 trillion at the end of 2011. The notional amount of outstanding exchange traded derivatives was $70 trillion at the end of 2011. Making OTC markets roughly ~10x larger then exchange traded markets, and is expected to grow at a faster rate.

### 1.3 Forward Contracts 
A new simple derivative is a forward contract. It is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price. It can be contrasted with a spot contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset today. A forward contract is traded in the over the counter market, usually between two financial institutions, or one of their clients.

In the contract, one party assumes a long position and agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price.
The other party assumes a short position and agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.

Forward contracts can be used to hedge currency risk.

#### Payoffs from Forward Contracts
Payoffs from forward contracts 

*Spot and forward quotes for the USD/GBP exchange rate, May 24, 2010 (USD/GBP)*
| Contract Type   | Bid    | Offer  |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Spot            | 1.4407 | 1.4411 |
| 1-month forward | 1.4408 | 1.4411 |
| 2-month forward | 1.4410 | 1.4413 |
| 3-month forward | 1.4416 | 1.4422 |

Consider purchasing £1,000,000  on a 6 month contract at $1,442,200.
If the spot exchange rate were to rise to 1.5 at the end of the 6 months, the contract would be worth $57,800.
($1,500,000 - $1,442,200 = $57,800)

In General, the payoff from a long forward contract on one unit of an asset is:
*S<sub>T</sub> - K* 

The Payoff from a short position in a forward contract is:
*K - S<sub>T</sub>*

Where *K* is the delivery prices and *S<sub>T</sub>* is the spot price of the asset a maturity of the contract *T*
These payoffs can be positive or negative

Because it costs nothing to enter a forward contract, the payoff from th contract is also the trader's total gain or loss from the contract.

### 1.4 Futures Contracts
Like a forward contract, a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price. However, a Futures contract is normally traded on an exchange, with specified, standardized features of the contract.

A wide variety of commodities and finnacial assets are traded as futures contracts. These include agricultural products, energy products, metals, stock indices, interest rates, and foreign exchange.

### 1.5 Options
Options are traded both on exchanges and in the over the counter market.
There are 2 types of options: call options and put options.
A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price.
A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. 
The price in the contract is known as the *exercise/strike price*
The Date in the contract is known as the expiration date, or maturity.
It should be emphasized that an option is a right, not an obligation. The holder of the option can choose to exercise the option or not. If the holder does not exercise the option, it expires worthless.
